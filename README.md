# @targetd

A speedy, highly extensible, typed, in-memory data store built in Node.js &
Typescript.

It's perfect for storing any shape of data that can be "targeted" with
key/values.

## Installation

| JS Runtime | Command                                       |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js    | `npm install zod && npx jsr add @targetd/api` |
| Bun        | `bun add zod && bunx jsr add @targetd/api`    |
| Deno       | `deno add npm:zod jsr:@targetd/api`           |

## When to use @targetd

- Configuration
- Small blogs/websites

## When _not_ to use @targetd

- With big data
- For tokenising/searching data

## How it works

All data is stored in a list of "rules". Each rule contains a "name", "payload"
and an optional "targeting" property that can be "queried".

All payloads, targeting & queries are typed & validated at runtime & compile
time.

An example rule:

```json
{
  "name": "blog",
  "payload": {
    "title": "A news thing",
    "body": "Here's the body"
  },
  "targeting": {
    "category": ["news", "weather"]
  }
}
```

The above example shows a payload which will **only** be found when a query will
match it's targeting structure.

**BEFORE GOING FURTHER** please note that the `Data` class is entirely immutable
meaning that you must use the returned value of every function. For exampe:

```typescript
import { Data } from '@targetd/api'

// THE BELOW IS INCORRECT!!! the data object has not had any targeting or rules added
const data = await Data.create()
await data.useTargeting(...)
await data.addRules(...)

// âœ… This is better.
const data = await Data.create({ ...initialOptions })
  .useTargeting(...)
  .addRules(...)
```

### Typing Data (payloads)

All typing and validation is done using the awesome [zod][zod] project and is
exported from the `@targetd/api` package. [Zod][zod] is an easy project to
understand and you'll need to know some of the basics.

```typescript
import { Data } from "@targetd/api";
import z from "zod/v4";

let data = await Data.create().usePayload({
  blog: z.strictObject({
    title: z.string(),
    body: z.string(),
  }),
});
```

Now I can safely add some rules. Without the above, however, you'll receive an
error that you cannot add to the 'blog' data type.

```typescript
data = await data.addRules([
  {
    name: "blog",
    payload: {
      title: "A news thing",
      body: "Here's the body",
    },
  },
]);
```

### Typing Targeting

As mentioned above, all typing and validation is done using the [zod][zod]
project.

```typescript
data = await data.useTargeting({
  category: {
    // Restrict queries to be string
    queryParser: z.string(),

    // Restrict stored targeting values as an array of "news" or "weather"
    targetingParser: z.array(z.enum(["news", "weather"])),

    // The targeting logic
    predicate: (query) => (targeting) => targeting.includes(query),
  },
});
```

Now one can safely target by `category` without receiving an error.

```typescript
data = await data.addRules([
  {
    name: "blog",
    payload: {
      title: "A news thing",
      body: "Here's the body",
    },
    targeting: {
      category: ["news", "weather"],
    },
  },
]);
```

### Querying Data

```typescript
console.info(
  await data.getPayload("blog", { category: "news" }),
  // This will find the **first** rule that matches the query
);
// { title: 'A new thing', body: "Here's the body" }
```

### Fall through payloads

Sometimes you may not be able to successfully target certain payloads in one
service. When this happens you'll need to allow targeted payloads to "fall
through" to the next service. To allow this to happen, you can add "fall
through" targeting.

```typescript
// data.ts
import { Data } from "@targetd/api";

export const data = await Data.create().usePayload({ foo: z.string() });
```

```typescript
// service-1.ts
import { targetIncludes } from "@targeted/api";
import { z } from "zod/v4";
import { data } from "./data";

export const service1Data = await data
  .useTargeting({
    weather: targetIncludes(z.string()),
  })
  .useFallthroughTargeting({
    browser:    targetIncludes(z.string()),
  });
  .addRules("foo", [
    {
      targeting: {
        // Targeting "browser" cannot be targeted by this server
        // and therefore will be passed to service-2
        browser: ["chrome"],
        weather: ["sunny"],
      },
      payload: "Chrome and sunny",
    },
  ]);
```

```typescript
// service-2.ts
import { targetIncludes } from "@targeted/api";
import { z } from "zod/v4";
import { data } from "./data";

const service2Data = await data
  .useTargeting({
    browser: targetIncludes(z.string()),
  });
  .insert(
    data.getPayloadForEachName({ weather: "sunny" }),
  );

// ...
```
